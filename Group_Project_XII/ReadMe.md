# Group Project Class 12

## Project Description

This is a very simple project which was created to basically understand the usage of mysql.connector module in python. It provides a database for storing and manipulating data of tourist destinations for a travel agency. Currently it relies on the system's own mysql server to store the data, and thus asks for system password to connect to the database.

## Requirements

- Mysql server
- Mysql.connector module
- prettytable module
- The will power to ignore all the warnings and errors your IDE must be giving (This is a very old project, and I don't want to fix them)

No need for recommandations with this one. Its a old gem and is PERFECT.
