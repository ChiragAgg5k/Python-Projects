This is a very simple and small document which uses the basics of python to convert snake casing to camel casing and vice a versa.

Snake Casing - type of casing where all the letters are small and each word is seperated by a underscore
Camel Casing - type of casing where there is no separation between each word and all the words are capitalized.
