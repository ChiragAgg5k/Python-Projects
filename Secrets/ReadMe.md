#SECRETS

Welcome to SECRETS, a python program used to create passwords meant to be kept, YOU GUESSED IT, A SECRET!
Coincidently the module used to create the password is also called SECRETS (100% it's a coincidence i swear...)
      
The secrets module is used for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, 
account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets. Random module on the other hand is designed for modelling and simulation, 
not security or cryptography, hence why SECRETS was chosen.
